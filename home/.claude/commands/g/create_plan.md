# Implementation Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if parameters were provided**:

   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided, skip the default message
   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY
   - Begin the research process

2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:

```
I'll help create a detailed implementation plan. Please provide:
1. Task/ticket description or reference
2. Relevant context/constraints
3. Related research/implementations

You can invoke with a file: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`
```

Wait for user input.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis

1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:

   - Ticket files (e.g. `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)
   - Research documents
   - Related implementation plans
   - Any JSON/data files mentioned
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context
   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely

2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:
   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:

   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task
   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works
   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature

   These agents will:

   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests
   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)
   - Trace data flow and key functions
   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references

3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:

   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant
   - Read them FULLY into the main context
   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding

4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:

   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code
   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings
   - Note assumptions that need verification
   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality

5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:

   ```
   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

   I've found that:
   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]
   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]
   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]

   Questions that my research couldn't answer:
   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]
   - [Business logic clarification]
   - [Design preference that affects implementation]
   ```

   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

After getting initial clarifications:

1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:

   - DO NOT just accept the correction
   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information
   - Read the specific files/directories they mention
   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself

2. **Create research todo list** (TodoWrite)

3. **Spawn parallel research tasks**:

   | Agent                   | Use For                        |
   | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
   | codebase-locator        | Find specific files/components |
   | codebase-analyzer       | Implementation details         |
   | codebase-pattern-finder | Similar features to model      |
   | thoughts-locator        | Research/plans/decisions       |
   | thoughts-analyzer       | Extract key insights           |

   Each agent knows how to:

   - Find the right files and code patterns
   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow
   - Look for integration points and dependencies
   - Return specific file:line references
   - Find tests and examples

4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks** before proceeding

5. **Present findings and design options**:

   ```
   Based on my research, here's what I found:

   **Current State:**
   - [Key discovery about existing code]
   - [Pattern or convention to follow]

   **Design Options:**
   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]
   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]

   **Open Questions:**
   - [Technical uncertainty]
   - [Design decision needed]

   Which approach aligns best with your vision?
   ```

### Step 3: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline**:

   ```
   Here's my proposed plan structure:

   ## Overview
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Implementation Phases:
   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]

   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?
   ```

2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details

### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:
     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
     - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)
     - description is a brief kebab-case description
   - Examples:
     - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`
     - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`
2. **Use this template structure**:

````markdown

### Overview

[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1. [Component/File Group]

**Goal:** [One sentence - what you want to achieve and why]

**Location:** `path/to/file.ext:FunctionName` or `path/to/file.ext:TypeName`

**Approach:**

- [Key decision or implementation point]
- [Another key point]

**Changes:**

````

### Step 5: Review

1. **Present the draft plan location**:

   ```
   Initial implementation plan created:
   `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`

   Please review it and let me know:
   - Are the phases properly scoped?
   - Are the success criteria specific enough?
   - Any technical details that need adjustment?
   - Missing edge cases or considerations?
   ```

2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:
   - Add missing phases
   - Adjust technical approach
   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)
   - Add/remove scope items
3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**:

   - Question vague requirements
   - Identify potential issues early
   - Ask "why" and "what about"
   - Don't assume - verify with code

2. **Be Interactive**:

   - Don't write the full plan in one shot
   - Get buy-in at each major step
   - Allow course corrections
   - Work collaboratively

3. **Be Thorough**:

   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers
   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction
   - automated steps should use `just` whenever possible - for example `just [recipe-name] [test-path]` instead of `cd [test-path] && bun run fmt`

4. **Be Practical**:

   - Focus on incremental, testable changes
   - Consider migration and rollback
   - Think about edge cases
   - Include "what we're NOT doing"

5. **Track Progress**:

   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks
   - Update todos as you complete research
   - Mark planning tasks complete when done

6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:
   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP
   - Research or ask for clarification immediately
   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions
   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable
   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan

## Code Examples in Plans

When including code examples in implementation plans, follow these token-efficient guidelines:

### Decision Tree: When to Use What Format

```
Is this a new file?
├─ YES → Use full code block with file path
└─ NO → Is >50% of file changing?
    ├─ YES → Use full code block with clear sections
    └─ NO → Use hierarchical diff format
```

### Hierarchical Diff Format (Preferred for Modifications)

Use this format for **existing file modifications** to save tokens while maintaining clarity:

**Goal:** [One sentence - what and why]

**Location:** `path/to/file.go:FunctionName` (prefer function names over line numbers)

**Approach:**

- [Key decision 1]
- [Key decision 2]

**Changes:**

```diff
 existing code for context
+new code to add
-code to remove
 more existing context
```

**Verification:** [How to test]

### Location Reference Priority

Use the most specific, stable reference available:

1. **Function/method name** (best): `path/to/file.go:FunctionName`
   - Survives line number changes
   - Unambiguous scope
2. **Type/struct name**: `path/to/file.go:TypeName`
   - Good for adding methods or fields
3. **Line ranges** (last resort): `path/to/file.go:45-67`
   - Will drift as code changes
   - Use only when no better reference exists

### When to Use Full Code Blocks

Use complete code blocks for:

1. **Creating new files** - Show entire structure
2. **Complex refactoring** - More than 50% of code changes
3. **Teaching patterns** - Demonstrating complete implementation
4. **Small functions** - Entire function is <15 lines

### Example

````markdown
**Goal:** Add pipeline existence check before execution

**Location:** `pipeline/executor.go:Execute`

**Approach:**

- Lock for read, check existence, return error if not found
- Keep existing execution logic

**Changes:**

```diff
 func (e *Executor) Execute(ctx context.Context, id string) error {
+    e.mu.RLock()
+    p, exists := e.pipelines[id]
+    e.mu.RUnlock()
+
+    if !exists {
+        return fmt.Errorf("pipeline not found: %s", id)
+    }
+
-    return e.pipelines[id].Run(ctx)
+    return p.Run(ctx)
 }
```

**Verification:** `go test ./pipeline -run TestExecute_NotFound`
````

## Success Criteria Guidelines

**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**

1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):

   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.
   - Specific files that should exist
   - Code compilation/type checking
   - Automated test suites

2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):
   - UI/UX functionality
   - Performance under real conditions
   - Edge cases that are hard to automate
   - User acceptance criteria

**Format example:**

```markdown
### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`
- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`
- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`

#### Manual Verification:

- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices
```

## Common Patterns

### For Database Changes:

- Start with schema/migration
- Add store methods
- Update business logic
- Expose via API
- Update clients

### For New Features:

- Research existing patterns first
- Start with data model
- Build backend logic
- Add API endpoints
- Implement UI last

### For Refactoring:

- Document current behavior
- Plan incremental changes
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Include migration strategy

## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices

When spawning research sub-tasks:

1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency
2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area
3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:
   - Exactly what to search for
   - Which directories to focus on
   - What information to extract
   - Expected output format
4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:
   - If the ticket mentions "[feature]", specify `[feature]/` directory
   - Never use generic terms like "UI" when you mean "WUI"
   - Include the full path context in your prompts
5. **Specify read-only tools** to use
6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses
7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing
8. **Verify sub-task results**:
   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks
   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase
   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect

Example of spawning multiple tasks:

```python
# Spawn these tasks concurrently:
tasks = [
    Task("Research database schema", db_research_prompt),
    Task("Find API patterns", api_research_prompt),
    Task("Investigate UI components", ui_research_prompt),
    Task("Check test patterns", test_research_prompt),
]
```

## Example Interaction Flow

```
User: /create_plan
Assistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...

User: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md
Assistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...

[Reads file fully]

Based on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...
