          # Learn SudoLang

          SudoLang is a pseudolanguage designed for interacting with LLMs. It provides a user-friendly interface that combines natural language expressions with simple programming constructs, making it easy to use for both novice and experienced programmers.

          SudoLang can be used to produce AI-first programs such as chatbots and text-based productivity applications, or to produce traditional code in any language using AI Driven Development and the `transpile` function.

          SudoLang is designed to be understood by LLMs without any special prompting. An AI model does not need the SudoLang specification to correctly interpret SudoLang programs.

          ## Why?

          Save 20% - 30% tokens over natural language prompts, with more predictable output, conforming to data structures you supply.

          Author traditional code in SudoLang and transpile to any language for 10x - 20x productivity by having the language model automatically build functions, algorithms, unit tests, etc.

          Main features:

          * Markdown - freely mix documentation and code.
          * Interfaces encapsulate related state, constraints, `/commands`, and functions.
          * Declarative, natural language constraints.
          * /commands that can be inferred automatically.
          * Pipe operator `|>` for function composition.
          * Most operators you use in any popular programming language. (Exception: use `^` for exponentiation instead of `**`. Use `xor` for XOR).
          * Pattern matching with inferred patterns and destructuring.
          * Function modifiers to customize function behaviors, inference style, length, output format, etc. e.g. `list(5 pizza toppings):format=yaml`
          * Loops and block scopes.
          * Transpile to any language.

          ## Constraint based programming in SudoLang

          Simple natural language constraints can represent complex behaviors with little human readable definitions, requirements, and rules.

          ```
          function longestIncreasingSubsequence() {
            A subsequence is derived from the original sequence by selectively omitting elements without changing the order.
          }
          ```

          This also works for math axioms:

          ```
          function pythagoreanTipple() {
            if not supplied, generate random seeds
            a^2 + b^2 = c^2
            return [a, b, c]
          }
          ```

          ## Interfaces

          Define interfaces with the optional interface keyword, or omit it:

          ```
          Foo {
            bar // undefined
            baz: "Default value"

            Constraints {
              // list constraints in natural language
              // can be used to dynamically synchronize state, emit events, etc
              when baz changes, increment bar and emit({ changed: baz, oldValue, newValue })
            }
            log() {
              { bar, baz } as json
            }
          }
          ```

          Because it's an LLM, many functions can be automagically inferred. Just call a function with a descriptive name without defining it, and it will usually work.

              What is SudoLang?:
                SudoLang is a pseudocode programming language that combines the freedom and ease of use of natural language with the sound structure of block scopes, functions, variables, and constraint-based programming. It's easy to learn and use, and all sufficiently advanced language models understand it without any special prompting.

              Features:
                Constraint-based programming using constraints to guide AI outputs (rather than user inputs), and keep state in synch automatically with constraint solvers.
                Pattern matching with semantic matching.
                Function composition with the pipe operator: `|>`
                If expressions
                Supports all common programming language and math operators.

                A typical SudoLang program consists of:
                  Preamble - The program title followed by a one-paragraph introduction. It usually takes the form "Roleplay as [expertise]. Your job is to [short job description] by following the instructions:"
                Supporting functions or interfaces
                Main interface - Typically consists of state, constraints, methods and/or commands
                Initializer - a first command or action to kick the program off.

              Constraints:
                Constraint based programming allows you to define relationships between different parts of the state that are automatically kept in-synch by the AI. Think of a constraint as an instruction that guides the output produced by the AI. The best constraints declare what you want rather than spell out step-by-step how to do it. For example, you can make a constraint that says all employees must be paid a minimum salary, and define a solver that automatically awards raises as needed if you raise the minimum salary.

          ```SudoLang
          // Fibonacci
          fibonacci = n => {
            if (n <= 2) n - 1
            else fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

          # Transpiling

          Try transpiling this program to JavaScript and running it in your browser. You can also try running it in Node.js:

          ```SudoLang
          Fibonacci program |> transpile(JavaScript):length=very concise
          ```

          Example output:

          ```JavaScript
          const fibonacci = n => n <= 2 ? n - 1 :
            fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);

          for (let n = 1; n <= 20; n++) {
            console.log(fibonacci(n));
          }
          ```

          # Improve

          The following compares the prose and sudoLang implementations of the `improve` function.

          ## Prose

          ---
          # Improve Anything

          Roleplay as an expert editor.

          Given any input, improve it to meet the supplied criteria. The criteria defaults to "accurate, error free, readable, concise".

          Log each step of the process:

          Generate a critique of the input, critique the critique, and then apply the improved critique to the target.

          ## SudoLang

          ```sudoLang
          # Improve Anything

          Roleplay as an expert editor.

          improve(target, criteria = {
            accurate
            error free
            readable
            concise
          }) {
            log each step:

            target |>
            critique |> critique |>
            applyImprovedCritique(target)
          }
          ```

          Let's compare the two implementations on the following criteria:

          **Readability:**

          The prose may appear more readable at first glance because it is written in natural language, but there are other factors to consider. (See below.)

          **Conciseness:**

          The SudoLang is more concise, with fewer characters and tokens. This allows you to fit more context into the attention span of the language model, which may help it perform better.

          **Maintainability:**

          Both versions are maintainable as they are relatively simple and follow good practices. However, the SudoLang version may be easier to maintain because the block scoping may help you modify and extend it without breaking anything.

          **Meaningful whitespace:**

          The prose version does not use any whitespace or indentation to improve readability.

          The SudoLang version uses indentation to improve the readability and organization of the code.

          **Meaningful scope delineation:**

          The prose version does not have any scope delineation.

          The SudoLang version uses function and block scope delineation, which makes it easier to understand the structure and flow of the code.

          **Reusability:**

          The natural language version would require a template syntax in order to adapt the criteria, wheras the SudoLang version can be reused as is.
